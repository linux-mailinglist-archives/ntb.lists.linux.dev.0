Ok. Will fix in v6.

Calling .set_bar() without calling .clear_bar() is not a problem.
In fact, that is how the NTB EPF dynamically switches the inbound address
translation for a BAR on the fly, after the host has assigned a PCI address
for the BAR.

It is just that for most EPF drivers, you would normally call .clear_bar()
before calling .set_bar() again.

The NTB EPF does this to change the inbound address translation from one
address to another on the fly. For details about why the NTB EPF driver does
this, you would need to ask Frank who implemented this.

Correct, BAR size and BAR type has to be the same.
I don't know why the NTB EPF does this, but it is obvious that very bad
things could happen if you would dynamically change from one BAR size to
another. (This is not a resizable BAR...)

If we allowed the BAR sizes of the old area and the new area to differ,
that could mean that we could leak kernel memory, since if e.g. the new area
is smaller than the old area, a read past the new area size would potentially
read memory that wasn't allocated by the EPF.

To me, is seems like quite a big oversight that these safe guards wasn't
added as part of commit 4284c88fff0e ("PCI: designware-ep: Allow
pci_epc_set_bar() update inbound map address"), but then as you might have
seen, that patch was also merged via the NTB tree without any Ack from the
PCI endpoint maintainers. This patch has a Fixes-tag against that commit,
so stable should pick this up. I will also add an explict Cc: stable in v6.


Kind regards,
Niklas
