Terribly sorry about that! I was reading another thread just before this
and misspelled your name.

Kishon being the maintainer proposed an entirely different way of representing
the driver. I agree that the patch is working but maintainer's view matters and
if you don't hear from the maintainer for some time, you'll ping them (Frank
did ping but there is something called RESEND).

I'm not sure that merging the patches without an ACK from the relevant subsystem
maintainer is the right thing to do.

I'd argue that you should've waited for the ACK first. I've seen and
experienced patch series hanging there for multiple releases. I'm not in favour
of not responding to the patches, maintainers do have their own work to do but
merging the patches touching the different subsystem without an ACK doesn't
sound good to me.

I don't know why he didn't object when the series got merged in this manner :/

It's now fine that NTB related PCI patches can be merged through NTB tree but
please wait for an ACK for patches touching the non-NTB drivers. If you ask me
how long you should wait, then I don't have an answer, but atleast give a
notice before doing so that it can catch the proper eyes.
