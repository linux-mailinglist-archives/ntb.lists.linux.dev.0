sysfs? Did you mean debugfs?
Anyway the DebugFS interface will be indeed backward compatible, but
functionally the performance test won't be the same. AFAICS at the
very least the burst-latency test is executed by default together with
the standard performance test. It may cause ntb_test.sh regressions on
the systems (the test will fail if the latency is too high), which
haven't had any problem before.

Good. It will be much easier to do should you have the latency test
implemented as a separate driver.

Yeah, it's very handy, isn't it? =)
Originally it has been created in a way so the perf-test would be
portable across all the supported NTB HW types: local- and peer-based
MW xlate address setup (Intel/AMD/Switchtec NTB HW vs IDT NTB HW),
Scratchpad and Messages capable devices (Intel/AMD/Switchtec NTB HW vs
IDT NTB HW). My idea was to provide a reference of how a portable NTB
application could be designed. (It took some hard time to debug that
part on the Intel/AMD hardware since nobody of the current maintainers
had an access to one at that moment.) On the next step I was going to
move the communication part of the ntb_perf driver to a separate
kernel module as a communication library (which could be used for the
inter-domains basic communications on top of the DB+Spad/MSG
interface), but alas didn't find a time to get to work on it.

What would be much better if you detached the infrastructure part into
a separate module, which could be afterwards used by the ntb_perf and
your ntb_latency drivers.

What would be the best if you created it as a kernel library with a
well-defined interface, which could be used not only by the test
drivers, but by any kernel application (most importantly by the NTB
transport driver) for the basic communications (like MW xlate address
exchange, portable MW xlate address setup, etc).
