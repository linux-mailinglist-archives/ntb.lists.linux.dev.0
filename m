I assume you mean me.  Odd that you got my name wrong 2 lines below it
being properly written out.

To your point, this is already in Linus' tree.  If it is not the way
people want it, patches accepted.

Kishon (in the thread) recommended doing it one way, and Frank
responded he liked doing it another.  Kishon didn't respond to that
last email.  To me, this is an acceptable technical disagreement that
can be addressed in the future and no need to prevent working patches
from being accepted.

I put the series in my ntb-next branch, which was pulled into linux-next
for roughly 3 months, and he did not object then (though likely he did
not notice).  Multiple patches were submitted to the relevant mailing
lists to address minor issues in the series (from being in linux-next)
and most/all of those hit the PCI mailing list.  Bjorn responded to
all of them saying they needed to go through the ntb tree (because of
the dependency on Frank Li's original series).  So while not an
explicit ack, it was implicit to me in that he was aware of the
series.

Given the length of time and the public work on the series, how much
longer should I have waited for a nack?

Completely unfounded, per Bjorn's comment on
