No, I don't think there's any BIOS settings needed. It could be a
problem with the switch configuration, but I'm not entirely sure what it
would be. Crosslink configurations are also super tricky.

The fact that it comes up some of the time suggest there's a race
condition or something along those lines while the driver sets up the
switch. So this may take some effort to debug.

It's hard to say, but I suspect the doorbells on the receive side are
not getting through. Can you confirm that when it is broken you don't
get any debug messages like "ntb_transport_rxc_db: doorbell 0 received".

Another thing that you could try is to dump the registers for both
switches when it's working and broken. You can use the switchtec user
tool for this. 'switchtec gas dump' will dump the entire register space
in hex. The NTB registers to take a look at start at 0x10000. If we can
notice a difference between broken and working we can narrow down what
is not being setup correctly.
