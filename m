Linus, Greg,

First of all thanks to you for taking by far not the most harmful actions=
 to achieve what your lawyers very kindly asked you to do.

Unfortunately, already a lot of highly qualified people have started thin=
king that you acted very badly. Of course, there are questions like why r=
emoved maintainers were not properly notified and did not receive any add=
itional explanations, but, to my mind, it is useless to try to find 100% =
justice -- it is not possible. Overton windows has been opened a bit more=
.

Usually the first contribution is much harder to make then the following =
ones. A big problem here is that now many people even will not try to con=
tribute to the Linux kernel and other open source projects: their pride f=
or themselves, their homeland, their colleagues has been severely hurt (w=
e are ready to fight for all that).

It is not clear what to do with this problem. Any ideas?

I am sure that people from any country and of any nationality will have s=
imilar feelings if you act with them or their colleagues in a similar way=
.

Thanks to people who were not afraid to say something against this action=
. Chinese, Latin American, African and other people probably understand t=
hat they may be the next ones to be dropped from maintainers. Hope that w=
e will not have to form another Linux kernel upstream one day...

I am sorry that you have to read a lot of text from people who you call t=
rolls -- it is hard to keep calm.

You know, you have really made it much harder to motivate people to contr=
ibute into the kernel. There is such problem among developers of hardware=
 that they do not feel comfortable enough to show their code, for example=
 because they think that it is not perfect. Let=E2=80=99s take Baikal Ele=
ctronics. They do publish their kernel code, but in a form of tarballs wi=
thout git. They slowly, but constantly worked on contributing support of =
their hardware into the upstream kernel, fixing not Baikal-related bugs b=
y the way. One day someone told them that =E2=80=9Cwe are not comfortable=
 with accepting your patches=E2=80=9D. And they stopped their work on ups=
tream. Now that man has been removed from maintainers of previously contr=
ibuted code (code for not Russian hardware, by the way).

What do I suggest to do? Well, I don=E2=80=99t know, but I do not see dir=
ect legal reasons why doing this was required and why patches from Baikal=
 could not be accepted (the fact that I do not see does not mean that the=
y do not exist, but please show them). Politicians and activists can be s=
hown a finger in some places, by both developers and lawyers, at least to=
 prevent them from being too ambitious, when they decide to break somethi=
ng working next time... But maybe I do not know something about truly dem=
ocratic regimes :-)

Thanks for reading.
