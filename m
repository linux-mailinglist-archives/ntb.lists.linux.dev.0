Hi Serge,

Thank you for the very detailed comments.

As described in the cover commit message, the resulting test is fully
backward compatible. I mean that if we don't fiddle with the new sysfs
entries, then no latency measures are performed, and the test works as
it did before the patch set.
Also, I plan to make changes to "ntb_test.sh" script accordingly, after
this patch set is merged.

Reasonable. I can easily change this part.

The whole 'latency' part relies on 'ntb_perf' infrastructure. Moreover,
the first patch adds only one meaningful function.  Thus separatin theg
'latency' part will make me copy a lot of code. As a compromise, I can
offer to put latency-related code into a separate .c file but leave the
whole test in a single module. That should increase readability and
eliminate code duplication.

Let's call for the third opinion.
