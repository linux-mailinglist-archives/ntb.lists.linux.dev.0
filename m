Then why should we have 2 similar functions with only couple of lines
difference? I think re-using code is always preferable unless it makes
the code unclear.
Prefixed underscore is OK. Maybe it's better to rename the local
variable at all.

These all were made on purpose. The main usages for the NTB performance
measurement are to evaluate new hardware and to tune its settings. In
the real world 1 iteration can last from tens ns to hundreds ms. It's a
huge difference. And while in my opinion the best measurement results
are gained through 1000 iterations, it may turn the test system
irresponsible for several minutes in the worst case. And contrary, too
low value being hardcoded would produce quite inaccurate results in the
best case.
Therefore it's better to use a parameter, which is predictable for a
user. So LAT_MIN_TRIES macro is defined to protect the test accuracy from
too low 'lat_time_ms' value. And also sysfs entry for 'tries' variable helps
to evaluate accuracy.
